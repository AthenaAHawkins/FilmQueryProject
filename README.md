# FilmQueryProject

# Description
This project takes input from a user, based on either a keyword or an id. These are then ran through the methods and utilize the SQL statements to navigate through the database and pull the correct info which will then display back to the terminal. The user will be asked if they want to continue to input choices and the program will continue until they say no. 

# Technologies Used
SQL, eclipse terminal 

# Lessons Learned
The biggest take away from this project for me was utilizing my methods in conjunction with my SQL statements. I had an issue where I was trying to do too much with my SQL statement and it ended up breaking my code. (I also broke the TAs for over an hour but that in itself was a great way to learn more about trouble shooting.) What I failed to realize prior to this assignment was how the methods can work together to call, compile and process smaller pieces of data. Instead, I had thought that one method was in charge of handling everything at once. Instead, it should be smaller methods to run smaller pieces of SQL statements and then using your getters with the methods to compile all the information into what you need. 
I felt like this was an invaluable learning experience for me as without it, i'd probably continue to make the same mistake.
